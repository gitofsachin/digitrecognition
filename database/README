MNIST folder contains MNIST database from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
	It is a database of many 28x28 handwritten digits and corresponding digits
	The images are all embedded into a single file

readdata.m reads above MNIST database to a cell array of two dimensional image
	Usage: [trainimage,traindata,testimage,testdata] = readdata(imagesreqd)
	trainimage{1} will have first image (transposed) - Notice {} instead of ()
	traindata(1) will have digit corresponding to trainimage{1}
	Similarly test image and data
